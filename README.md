# Mutan-Year-Zero-Dice-Roller
MYZ is a tabletop game from free league publishing, this dice roller follows the game rules:
The player has 3 set of five dice each set has color, yellow, green and black.
During the first roll 6 are interpreted as a Success and ones are ignored,
If no 6 is rolled the player has the chance to re roll but with punishment,
From the initial dice pool yellow and black ones are saved and the rest of the dice
are re re-rolled, ones from the first roll are added to the newly obtained ones, and that is passed
as damage (yellow dice) and equip damage (black dice) to the toon.
The code is GNU of if you can make better just let me know,
this is my first program ever so there it is.
